# Web3 - Week 0

For this assignment, you would be creating a your own blockchain in JS! While the actual blockchains are decentralised and there is a lot at play, for starting off, we will be creating a simple blockchain that allows addition of new blocks and new transactions!

In the subsequent weeks, we will be building on top of this to add more features!

### How to do the assignment

- You need to complete the functions in the `/src` folder that have been left blank. Comments are placed everywhere so as to guide you.
- Get started by running `npm i` on your terminal to install all the dependencies.
- Run `npm run test` to run the automated testing suite to evaluate the correctness of your code.
- Submit a `PR` to the original repository to get evaluated!
